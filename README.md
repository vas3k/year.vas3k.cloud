# My Year Planner (opinionated)

A simple one-pager app to plan your year. It’s an opinionated planner I’ve been using for years for my own quirky needs, but maybe you’ll find it useful too.

**The idea is simple:** it's a digital imitation of a wall calendar. You can paint days in different colors, emojis and textures, write any text on them, and shape the year your way. That's basically it. Use it however you want and don't forget to save your data.

It all works locally in your browser, no server or cloud involved. 100% private and offline.

Ideas, bugfixes and PRs are welcome. Open [issues](https://github.com/vas3k/year.vas3k.cloud/issues) to discuss.

> 😎 **Demo:** download [demo.json](./examples/demo.json), open [year.vas3k.cloud](https://year.vas3k.cloud), scroll down, click "Load Data" and select this file
