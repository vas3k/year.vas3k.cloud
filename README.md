# My Year Planner (opinionated)

A simple one-pager app to plan your year ahead. It’s an opinionated planner I’ve been using for years for my own quirky needs, but maybe you’ll find it useful too.

The idea is simple: it's a digital imitation of a wall calendar. You can color days in different colors and textures, write any text on it, and shape the year your way. That's basically it. Use it however you want and don't forget to save your data.

It all works locally in your browser, no server or cloud involved. 100% private.

Ideas, bugfixes and PRs are welcome. Open [issues](https://github.com/vas3k/year.vas3k.cloud/issues) to discuss.
